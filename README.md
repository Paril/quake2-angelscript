# Contributing

To make things simple for integration into future engines, the actual AngelScript portion of the game DLL (everything inside the "as" folder) is licensed under MIT; consider it a separate, standalone project that just relies on the Quake II game API.
Contributions must only be made to the MIT components. This repository will not accept PRs or contributions on the GPL components (although you're welcome to fork!); if you have a suggestion for a change to the GPL'd code, please open an issue and describe the change you'd like.
